# Ultimate Pig

This repository is for the Ultimate Pig assignment for The Iron Yard in Durham, NC.

The assignment was to build a computer simulation of Pig Solitaire and, using python class objects, to create at least three different types of AI players with three different styles of play. The programming logic and findings are summarized in the Jupyter Notebook file.
